Build a website as a hub of material supporting my position as an independent consultant.

Design it first. Take the first steps with the end in mind.

General Steps
- Determine what I want to portray
- Accumulate my recent resume content into a consolidated draft
	+ The site is essentially a web resume
	+ It will differ though. It will portray my interests and experiences in more general terms.
		- Take my current skills and boil them into more general engineering, technology and implementation philosophies.
			
- Design the framework [check]
- Execute the framework [check]
- Polish the framework [check]
	+ basic styles [check]
	+ animations [check]
	+ advanced styles [check]
		- icons [check]
	+ content
		- resume links [check]
		- footer [check]

	+ content
		- start by filling out the current framework
			+ set up the line-link option [check]
			+ set up the value/date display [chcek]
			+ curate content first	
				- arena dates (mke-12/20/2014?), minn-3/23/12, chi-1/3/15, ind-11/12/16, lac-12/9/2017), sites (food > cook, dine, drink), tunes (blogs, charts, write-ups)
			+ then try some shit with styles
				- be sure to maintain the terminal-vibe (no images)
				- horizonal dropdown (hoops, arenas)
					+ a <longways> node
		- animations (canvas)
		- rss feeds (twitter, craigslist, podcasts)
			+ could get descriptions or summaries via rss
			+ would need a server-side app to get the data (C#?)
			+ or try the rss2json api and see how that goes
			+ or experiment with iframes to host some content
		- favicon!
