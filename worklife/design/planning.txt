Build a website as a hub of material supporting my position as an independent consultant.

Design it first. Take the first steps with the end in mind.

General Steps
- Determine what I want to portray
- Accumulate my recent resume content into a consolidated draft
	+ The site is essentially a web resume
	+ It will differ though. It will portray my interests and experiences in more general terms.
		- Take my current skills and boil them into more general engineering, technology and implementation philosophies.
