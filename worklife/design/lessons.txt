Lessons learned from this journey -- 

AJAX is cool but not that well supported
Firefox, Chrome, Safari (the "better browsers") support the same XSLTProcessor object, however, they only support XSLT version 1.0
XSLT 2.0 was released in 2006 or so, yet it isn't acknowledged by the major browsers...
...XSL 2.0 has some useful features like string manipulation that would have been nice to have...

And IE... Oh boy. Really disappointed with the number of workarounds.
First, it uses its own XSLT processor -- msxml2.XMLHTTP.
This alternate processor has a more convoluted way of setting a parameter within the xsl file.

There was also an issue with utilizing CSS variables (which could be very nice to work with) in IE. Its JS engine pretends they're not there.

I think the way to avoid the issue of different XSLT processor standards is to define the XSL stylesheet from within the XML doc that its styling.
I wanted to load and combine the stylesheet and document on the fly, which I like, but IE doesn't support well.

But I think the better answer is to prefer JSON over AJAX and figure out what the JS-only version of the same approach would be
