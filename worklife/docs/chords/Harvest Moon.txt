4/4

(Em7)Come a little bit closer,
hear what I have to say. (D6) (DM7) (DM7/A)
(Em7)Just like the children sleeping,
we could dream this night away. (D6) (DM7) (DM7/A)

(G)But there's a full moon rising,
let's go dancing in the light. (D6) (DM7) (DM7/A)
(G)We know the music's playing,
let's go out and feel the night. (D6) (DM7) (DM7/A)

(G/A)Cause I'm still in love with you,
I want to see you (?) dance again.
(G/A)Cause I'm still in love with you,
on this harvest moon. (D6) (DM7) (DM7/A)

(Em7)When we were strangers,
I watched you from afar.
When we were lovers,
I loved you with all my heart.

(G)But now its getting late,
and the moon is climbing high.
I want to celebrate,
see it shining in your eye.

(G/A)Cause I'm still in love with you,
I want to see you dance again.
Cause I'm still in love with you,
on this harvest moon.
