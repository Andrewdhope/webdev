BABY BITCH - Ween

<<<put in a few of the D and Am variations>>>

Em G D Am
It's been a while since I've seen you smile
Em G D D
But now you've come back again
Em G D Am
Came into the room and you saw my girl
Em G D D
And you asked her how long it's been
Em G D Am
"A year" she said and you shook your head
Em G D (hold D)
Said "I'm surprised its gone on that long"

Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
For words I am at a loss
Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
I'm better now please fuck off

What else you gonna say while you're back on your stay
Maybe something, maybe nothing we'll see
It's just too bad, you're beautiful I guess
I wasn't for you and you weren't for me

Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Please slip back into yourself
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Go conquer someone else

People say, "How beautiful, how sweet, how kind"
You're perfect, you've got nothing to hide
But I, for one, have seen the sun
And the bitch that you've locked up inside
Got fat, got angry, started hating myself
Wrote "Birthday Boy" for you babe
Now I'm skinny and sick and paranoid
Without a cent to my name

Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Fuck you, you stinkin' ass ho
Most beauty I've seen
You come from a dream
But I can't close my eyes anymore
No, I can't close my eyes anymore
