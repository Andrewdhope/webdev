BABY BITCH - Ween

<<<put in a few of the D and Am variations>>>

Em G D Am
It's been a while since I've seen you smile
Em G D D
But now you've come back again
Em G D Am
Came into the room and you saw my girl
Em G D D
And you asked her how long it's been
Em G D Am
"A year" she said and you shook your head
Em G D (hold D)
Said "I'm surprised its gone on that long"

Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
For words I am at a loss
Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
I'm better now please fuck off

Em G D Am
What else you gonna say while you're back on your stay
Em G D D
Maybe something, maybe nothing we'll see
Em G D Am
It's just too bad, you're beautiful I guess
Em G D D
I wasn't for you and you weren't for me

Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
Please slip back into yourself
Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
Go conquer someone else

Em G D Am
People say, "How beautiful, how sweet, how kind"
Em G D D
You're perfect, you've got nothing to hide
Em G D Am
But I, for one, have seen the sun
Em G D D
And the bitch that you've locked up inside
Em G D Am
Got fat, got angry, started hating myself
Em G D D
Wrote "Birthday Boy" for you babe
Em G D Am
Now I'm skinny and sick and paranoid
Em G D D
Without a cent to my name

Em G D Am
Baby, Baby, Baby, Bitch
Em G D D
Fuck you, you stinkin' ass ho
Em G D Am
Most beauty I've seen you come from a dream
Em G D D
But I can't close my eyes anymore
No, I can't close my eyes anymore
