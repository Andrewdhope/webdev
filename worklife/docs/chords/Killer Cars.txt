[Verse 1]
G
Too hard on the breaks again
G/F#
What if these breaks just give in
C9
What if they dont get out of the way
D/F#
What if there's someone overtaking
G
I'm going out for a little drive
	G/F#
It could be the last time you see me alive
C9
There could be an idiot out on the road
	D/F#
The only kick in live is pumping his steel

[Chorus]
Am				G/B
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
C9					D
Packed with foam and blind drunk
Am					G/B	
They won't ever take me alive
	  Cm
Cause they all drive...

[Verse 2]
Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control
What if there's someone overtaking



[Chorus]
...
C#m						G					 			
Cause they all drive killer cars
C#m						G

[Interlude - Verse Chords]

[Chorus - open it up]
...
C#m						G					 			
Cause they all drive killer cars
Cause they all drive killer cars
Cause they all drive killer cars

[Outro - haul out]
C#m						G
