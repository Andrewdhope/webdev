[Verse]
  Type 2 
 Ohhhhhhhh 
  Type 1
 Oooooh ooooh
  Type 2
 I jumped into the river
  Type 3
 Black-eyed angels swam with me
  Type 2
 A moon full of stars and astral cars
  Type 3
 And all the figures i used to see
  Type 2
 All my lovers where there with me
  Type 3
 All my past and futures
  Type 2
 and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
  Type 3
 and there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
  Type 2, Type 1 (repeat again to start verse 2)
  
[Outro]
