TENNESSEE STUD - Billy Strings

[VERSE 1]
D					D
Back about eighteen twenty-five
C							Riff 1		D		
I left Tennessee barely half alive
D							D
I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud
D								C		D	Riff 2
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud

D							D
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
C							Riff 1		D
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
D							D
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
D						C		D	Riff 2
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

[CHOROUS]
D						F		D
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
G							F			A7 (002020)/(002030)
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
D					F			D
He had the nerve and he had the blood
chk-a-cka
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

[VERSE 2]
D					D
Drifted on down into no man's land
C								Riff 1	D
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
D						D
I raced my horse with the Spaniards foal
D							C			D	Riff 2
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

D						D
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
C							Riff 3		D
We got in a fight over Tennessee
D						D
We pulled our guns, he fell with a thud
D						C		D	Riff 2
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

[CHOROUS]

[VERSE 3]
D						D
I was as lonesome as a man could be
C						Riff 1		D
Dreaming of my gal in Tennessee
D						D			
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
D							C		D
Cause he was dreaming of his sweetheart too

D						D
We rode right back across Arkansas
C							Riff 1		D
I whooped her brother and I whooped her pa
D						D				
I found that girl with the golden hair
D						C		D
And she was riding on a Tennessee mare

[CHOROUS]

[VERSE 4]
D						D
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
C								Riff 3		D	
A little horse colt playing 'round the door
D						D
I love the girl with the golden hair
D						D
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

[CHOROUS]
