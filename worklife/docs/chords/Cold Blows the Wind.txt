(Em) Cold blows the wind over my true love
cold blows the (B7) drops of rain
I (Em) never had but one true love
and in Grantville (B7) he was slain

I'll (G) do as (D) much for (Am) my true love
as (G) any (Em) young girl (D) may
i'll (Em) sit and weep down (D) by his grave
for (Em) twelve month (B7) and one (Em) day

But (Em) when twelve months were come and gone
this young man (B7) he arose
what (Em) makes you weep down by my grave
I cannot (B7) take my (Em) repose

One (G) kiss, one (D) kiss of your (Am) lily white lips
one (G) kiss is (Em) all I (D) crave
one (Em) kiss, one kiss of your (D) lily white lips
and (Em) return (B7) back to your (Em) grave

My (Em) lips they are as cold as my clay
my breath is (B7) heavy and strong
if (Em) thou was to kiss my lily white lips
thy days (B7) would not be long

Oh (G) do you (D) remember the (Am) garden grove
where (G) we (Em) used to (D) walk
(Em) pluck the finest (D) flower of them all
twill (Em) wither (B7) into a (Em) stalk

Go (Em) fetch me a Nun from the dungeon deep
and water (B7) from a stone
and (Em) white milk from a maiden's breast
that babe (B7) ere never known

Go (G) dig me a (D) grave both (Am) long, wide and deep
as (G) quickly (Em) as you (D) may
I'll (Em) lie down in it and (D) take one sleep
for (Em) twelve month (B7) and one (Em) day

(Em) Cold blows the wind over my true love
cold blows the (B7) drops of rain
I (Em) never had but one true love
and in (B7) Grantville he was (Em) slain

I'll (G) do as much for (D) my true love
as (G) any (Em) young girl (D) may
i'll (Em) sit and weep down (D) by his grave
for (Em) twelve month (B7) and one (Em) day
