(Em) Cold blows the wind over my true love
cold blows the (B7) drops of rain
I (Em) never had but one true love
and in Camville (B7) he was slain

I'll (G) do as (D) much for (Am) my true love
as (G) any (Em) young girl (D) may
i'll (Em) sit and weep down (D) by his grave
for (Em) twelve month (B7) and one (Em) day

(Em)But when twelve months were come and gone
this young man he arose
what makes you weep down by my grave
I can't take my repose

(G)One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
one kiss is all I crave
one kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
and return back to your grave

(Em)My lips they are as cold as my clay
my breath is heavy and strong
if thou was to kiss my lily white lips
thy days would not be long

(G)Oh don't you remember the garden grove
where we used to walk
pluck the finest flower of them all
twill wither to a stalk

(Em)Go fetch me a Nun from the dungeon deep
and water from a stone
and white milk from a maiden's breast
that babe ere never known

(G)Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep
as quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep
for twelve month and one day

(Em)Cold blows the wind over my true love
cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
and in Camville he was slain

(G)I'll do as much for my true love
as any young girl may
i'll sit and weep down by his grave
for twelve month and one day
