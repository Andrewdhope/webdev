This life of sin, has got me in

Well its got me locked in prison once again
	G			G7			C

G								D			G	
I got twenty long years for some dust in a baggie


[VERSE 2]
Well if I only listened to what mom and pop had said

I wouldn't be locked up in prison struggling in the head

I took that little pipe and sucked until my mind was spun

Now I got twenty years to sit and think of what I done


[CHOROUS]


[VERSE 3]
Sometimes I sit and wonder where my little life went wrong

These old jailhouse blues have got me singing this here song

My life is a disaster lord and I feel so ashamed

Stuck here where they call me by a number not a name


[CHOROUS - OUTRO]
