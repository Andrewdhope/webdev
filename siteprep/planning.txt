Build a website as a hub of material supporting my position as an independent consultant.

Design it first. Take the first steps with the end in mind.

General Steps
- Determine what I want to portray
- Accumulate my recent resume content into a consolidated draft
	+ The site is essentially a web resume
	+ It will differ though. It will portray my interests and experiences in more general terms.
		- Take my current HIT skills and boil them into more general engineering, technology and implementation philosophies.
			+ Lean culture.
			+ Conversational capacity.
			+ Complete solutions. 
			+ Quality measurement.
		- Join the value-based care movement while separating from Epic.
		
- Design the framework [check]
- Execute the framework [check]

	+ basic styles [check]
	+ animations [check]
	+ advanced styles
	+ content
- Set up hosting [gh-pages]

Next steps: incorporate detail drill-downs.
